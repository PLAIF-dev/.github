## Introduce you as PLAIFer

If you are reading this section, you must be a new member of PLAIF. We are honored to have you with us! We would like you to introduce yourself to the other members so that we can get to know you better. Here are some tips on how to do that.

### 1. Write introduction

Please write a self-introduction page using markdown. Feel free to write about your job, the tools you use, and your interests. If you are stuck, you can refer to the following [example](/profile/software/members/jusung.md) and make a few changes. Here are the steps on how to write a self-introduction page.

1. `Clone` this repo (ex. `git clone https://github.com/plaif-dev/.github.git`)
2. Create a`branch` you are going to work on the introduction(ex. `git switch -c jusung/introduction`)
3. Create `a markdown` file with your name in the `members/` directory of the team you are in under the `/profile/` directory (e.g. `profile/software/members/jusung.md`).
   1. If you cannot find your team, create a directory with the name of your team and configure the directory with the following structure.

```plaintext
team name
‚îú‚îÄ team name.md
‚îî‚îÄ members/
    ‚îî‚îÄ your name.md
```

4. Write down your introduction the markdown file
5. Link the newly created page to the team page (e.g. `profile/software/software.md`) using a relative path.

### 2. Get peer reviews

Done writing your introduction? You are almost there. Please get peer reviews for `double-check`.There might be some typos! Let's check it out using the following method. (We are following github flow üòä.)

1. `Commit` Introduction(ex. `git commit -m "üìùdocs(introduction): add intro for someone"`)
2. `Push` Introduction(ex. `git push origin jusung/introduction`)
3. Send `Pull Request` for peer reviews(ex. [Pull Request in Web](https://github.com/PLAIF-dev/.github/compare))
